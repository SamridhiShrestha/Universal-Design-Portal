                <h2>Introduction To Girls Inc. Webpage</h2>
                <p>I helped create the UI/UX for this website my sophomore year of college when I was working with Blueprint Boulder. This organization, is a non-profit organization that creates websites and software for local companies and other non-profit local organization.  </p>
                <p>I think that this project was one of my favorite's due to the different compoenents of the website such as the side navigation and the automatic slide deck. </p>
                <p>I think that if I were to do this project again then I would make it using semantic html and I would also make it screen readable. </p>
