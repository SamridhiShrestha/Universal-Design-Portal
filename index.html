                <p> I am a senior in Computer Science & Engineering Management studying at the University of Colorado Boulder. I have about two years of experience working in the software industry and I am excited to be taking this course on Universal Design.</p>
                <p> I have a particular passion for UI/UX design and I am excited to learn more about this subset of software engineering.</p>
                <p>Outside of software engineering, I enjoy baking, as well as bouldering, and I am constantly trying out new hobbies and hope to take on pottery pretty soon.</p>
